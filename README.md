Puzzl generates a 3x3 puzzle from a random [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) image. Optional hints can be provided. When you win, the image is displayed in all its full-screen glory. Written in good ol' librariless, Vanilla JS with the drag-and-drop API.

Technically the code can support any size puzzle (number and size of squares). But trust me, beyond 3x3 and it gets hard. Don't you have something better to do on the Internet with your one and precious life?
